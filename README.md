# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Airbnb-Listings
Objective:

The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings in Paris, focusing particularly on pricing dynamics. Through this analysis, our aims are as follows:

1. Explore and profile the Airbnb listing data to identify and address any quality issues or anomalies.
2. Prepare and reformat the dataset to facilitate effective visualization and analysis.
3. Visualize the data comprehensively to uncover key insights into the factors influencing pricing trends in the Paris market.

Motivation:

As Airbnb gains popularity as a platform for short-term rentals, it faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, especially in highly regulated markets like Paris. Understanding the dynamics of Airbnb listings is crucial for regulatory compliance and strategic decision-making within the company. This project is motivated by the need to provide actionable insights to Airbnb leadership regarding the performance of listings in Paris, particularly in light of regulatory changes. By analyzing pricing trends and relevant factors, we aim to inform decision-making processes and optimize the platform's offerings for hosts and guests alike.

Background:

Airbnb, a pioneer in the sharing economy, facilitates the rental of private accommodations for travelers seeking alternatives to traditional hotels. However, as the platform has expanded globally, it has encountered regulatory challenges, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Paris. In response, cities like Paris have implemented regulations to manage the impact of short-term rentals on housing availability and affordability. Given the importance of the Paris market for Airbnb and the regulatory landscape surrounding short-term rentals, it is imperative to conduct a thorough analysis of Airbnb listings in Paris. By delving into the data, we can gain valuable insights into pricing dynamics, regulatory compliance, and the overall performance of Airbnb listings in this key market.
